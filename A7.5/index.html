    <h3><strong>The Development of US Craft Beer Industry in the last 10 years</strong></h3>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p><strong>DATA COLLECTION</strong></p>
    <p>With regards to my studio project, I am interested in the beer industry in terms of the development of breweries and beer production. During the early research stage, I have collected data related to the beer industry with the following information.<br>
    <br><br>

    <strong>Breweries/ Production</strong><br>
    No. of breweries<br>
    Size of breweries<br>
    Export
    Consumed on brewery premises<br>
    <strong>Ingredients</strong><br>
    Malt, Corn, rice, barley, wheat Consumption<br>
    Hops<br>
    <strong>Tax rate</strong><br>
    Tax rate on different barrel quantities<br>
    <strong>Policy/ Law changes</strong><br>
    Launch of Farm Brewery Law and Farm Brewery License<br>
    <strong>Definition of Craft Beer</strong><br>
    The definition of craft beer being defined by the Brewers Association changes<br>

    <strong>Data sources:</strong><br>
    Brewery Count by state (US)<br>

    <p><strong>POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS</strong></p>
    <p>For initial proposals, I designed 3 possible directions to represent the multiple sets of data to draw trends and relationships over the years. They aim to formulate a story about the beer industry, covering different aspects- from brewery numbers, beer production, production materials and licenses. From my analysis, the number of breweries increases in recent years. In specific, small-scale breweries increases while large-scale breweries remains unchanged or decreases slightly. This change is caused by the launch of specific license types (e.g. farm breweries) and the reduction of tax on small breweries. This shows a change in policy and economic measures affecting the trend. In terms of production materials, there is increase in hop consumption. This could be due to the change in tastes of beer consumers, leading to high demands of dry hops into creating specific beer types and flavors. <br>


    Initial Proposal 1
    One direction is to focus on the relationships of different data. Allowing users to select specific data sets to be displayed thus show the relationships or independence of data.

    Initial Proposal 2
    Another direction would be focusing on the user more specifically by allowing the user to enter information, so that the data would be displayed in relation to the user. For example, users can type in the ‘state’ to display data of a specific state to find out the brewery or beer information.

    Initial Proposal 3
    This proposal focuses on the part to whole relationship of data sources. By showing the general trends and big numbers of the beer industry, then zooming into the breakdowns of detailed informations (e.g. malt, barley, corn consumption). Users get to see the big picture and the small details respectively.
